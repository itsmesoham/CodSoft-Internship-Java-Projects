Task 1 (Guessing game)

A guessing game in Java prompts the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range, providing feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number, tracking the number of attempts made.

Task 2 (Student Grade Calculator)

A student grade calculator in Java computes a student's final grade by averaging scores from multiple subjects. It can also determine the corresponding letter grade based on predefined grading criteria.
